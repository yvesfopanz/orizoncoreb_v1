= Step 12: Upload Distribution Release

== Description

Move the release candidate from the dev area to the release area using a Subversion server-side copy.

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
svn mv https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/fineract/{revnumber} https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/fineract/
----

NOTE: https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html#upload-ci[This must be done by a Fineract PMC member].

You will now get an automated email from the Apache Reporter Service (no-reply@reporter.apache.org), subject "Please add your release data for 'fineract'" to add the release data (version and date) to the database on https://reporter.apache.org/addrelease.html?fineract (requires PMC membership).
