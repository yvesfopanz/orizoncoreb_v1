= Step 5: Create Release Tag

== Description

Next, you create a git tag from the HEAD of the release's git branch.

[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
git checkout -b release/{revnumber} <1>
git tag -a {revnumber} -m "Fineract {revnumber} release" -s <2>
git push origin tag {revnumber}
----
<1> Ensure all tests pass for this commit both in CI and locally.
<2> `-s` is optional but recommended: GPG signatures on tags are useful for trust and integrity.

CAUTION: It is important to create so called annotated tags (vs. lightweight) for releases.

== Gradle Task

.Command
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
