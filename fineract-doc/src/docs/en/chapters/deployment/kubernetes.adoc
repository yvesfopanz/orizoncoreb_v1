= Kubernetes

In a scaled Kubernetes environment where multiple Fineract instances are deployed, doing the database migrations properly is essential.

Fineract provides a way to run only the Liquibase migrations instead of starting up the whole application server so that you can easily do the migrations before actually upgrading a Fineract instance.

The `FINERACT_LIQUIBASE_ENABLED` flag controls whether Liquibase is enabled or not. For regular read/write/batch manager/batch worker instances this should be disabled.

There's a special Spring profile that should be enabled for running Liquibase only. In can be done via `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` environment variable. The profile name is `liquibase-only`. At the end of the migration process, the application will exit.

For the instance running the Liquibase migrations, the profile should be activated.
